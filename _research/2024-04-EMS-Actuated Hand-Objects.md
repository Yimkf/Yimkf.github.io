Unfortunately, our paper is rejected after rebuttal. Currently, we are preparing for next submission.

My Contributions :
1.  A novel concept of leveraging the loss of SoA caused by EMS to make the stimulated hand serve better as a virtual
object

2. Proposal of a highly reproducible electrode layout with a clear anatomical guide for actuating fingers via EMS and
inducing users to pose 8 gestures with it

3.  An interaction system that combined EMS actuation, deep learning model, and data glove to enable users to perform
gestural object retrieval tasks and be involved in interactive scenarios easily and immersively

Here is a demo video of the system in action:
