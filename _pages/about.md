I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EE](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/). My research interest includes haptics, force feedback, human-centered design, embodiments, and interface design combined with deep learning technologies.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shu](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ft/2021/1102/c29779a449585/page.htm) from [School of Future Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ft/), South China University of technology.
